# Proposal: Phase 1 - Setup & Authentication

## Summary
Execution of Phase 1 from the PRD, focusing on laying the technical foundation (Flutter + Supabase) and implementing the Hybrid Authentication (Email/Social + Solana Wallet).

## Objectives
1. **Project Verification**: Ensure Flutter project is correctly initialized with all dependencies.
2. **Backend Integration**: Connect app to Supabase project.
3. **Authentication**: Implement Email/Social login flow.
4. **Web3 Identity**: Implement Phantom Wallet connection via Deep Links.

## Motivation
To enable "Trustless Data Collection", we first need a verified user identity. This phase establishes the "Who" before we tackle the "What" (Data Capture) in Phase 2.

## Impact
- **Security**: Establishes the Auth barrier.
- **UX**: Sets the tone with a premium Login screen.
